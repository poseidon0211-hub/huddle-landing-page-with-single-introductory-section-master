## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

- This project was a great exercise in building a clean, modern landing page with a primary focus on responsiveness. The key challenge was arranging the card image and the content side-by-side on desktop and stacking them vertically on mobile.

- I used Flexbox to manage this layout. By setting `display: flex` on the hero section and using a media query to change the `flex-direction` from `column` to `row`, I could easily achieve the desired responsive behavior.


### Continued development

- I plan to continue practicing my responsive design skills, especially with CSS Grid, to build more complex and dynamic layouts. I also want to explore adding subtle CSS animations and transitions to create a more polished user experience.

### Useful resources

- [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) - I used this library for the social media icons, which provides a simple way to include modern icons without using images.
